# 🔁 Recycling and Reusing Components from Keypad Phones  
**A Reverse Engineering Approach for Sustainable E-Waste Management**

## 📄 Abstract

This project explores a hands-on reverse engineering methodology to disassemble, analyze, and recycle components and materials from old **keypad phones**. The study combines hardware teardown, component reuse, PCB processing, and copper extraction using chemical methods. We also analyze the environmental and economic impact of recycling these outdated devices, contributing to circular economy goals.

## 🔧 Methodology Overview

### 🪛 Disassembly & Component Evaluation
- Carefully removed components: LCDs, speakers, vibration motors, microphones, connectors.
- Cleaned and tested parts for reuse in repairs or academic projects.

### 🔬 PCB Processing & Copper Recovery
- **Desoldered** all SMD components using specialized stations.
- Removed **epoxy coating** via NaOH treatment.
- Attempted **thermal recovery**, then optimized **chemical leaching** using H₂SO₄ and H₂O₂.
- Extracted **CuSO₄ solution**, attempted copper precipitation using iron filings.

### 🔋 Battery Recycling
- Discharged lithium-ion battery using salt water for 7 days.
- Safely disassembled and recovered:
  - Copper foil
  - Aluminum casing
  - LiCoO₂ cathode material
  - Graphite
